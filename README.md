# ColombianStay

The growth of digital rental platforms has shaped global tourism, yet regional markets such as Colombia still lack affordable and scalable solutions tailored to local infrastructure and business needs. This work proposes an architecture for a mid-scale property rental platform designed to support core operations—such as bookings, payments, and reviews—while enabling analytical capabilities through an integrated data warehouse. Unlike cloud-centric models used by global platforms, the proposed design prioritizes modularity, maintainability, and cost efficiency through a service-oriented architecture using React, Django, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
